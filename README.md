## Notes
- Expo Go allows you to run React Native apps directly on your device without building them natively.  
- Make sure you have the same SDK version installed locally when developing with Expo.  
- If using `npx create-expo-app`, ensure it matches the Expo Go SDK to avoid runtime errors.

## Next Steps
- Install Node.js and `npm` (or `yarn`) to create and manage Expo projects.  
- Run the following to create a new project:  
  ```bash
  npx create-expo-app my-app
  cd my-app
  npx expo start
